# Aerial Fire Detection with Semantic Segmentation Research

This is an implementation of multiple Deep Learning models for fire semantic segmentation. This project utilizes the FLAME dataset, a widely recognized collection of labeled aerial imagery specifically designed for fire-related analysis, which is available [here](ieee-dataport.org/open-access/flame-dataset-aerial-imagery-pile-burn-detection-using-drones-uavs).
